# Online Book Review Application (Server-Side)

Welcome to the Online Book Review Application, a project developed as part of the IBM course "Developing Back-End Apps with Node.js and Express." This app provides a platform for users to manage books, write reviews, and engage with book-related content. It uses MySQL as the database and Sequelize.js for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

## Overview

The Online Book Review Application offers a RESTful API for managing users, books, and reviews. Users can create accounts, log in, and post reviews for books. Books can be added, updated, and deleted, while reviews can be written, edited, or removed. The app aims to deliver an easy and intuitive way for book lovers to share their opinions.
